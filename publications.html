                            One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human decision
                            behavior is accounting for the effect of context. Research shows
                            that seemingly minor changes in the presentation of a decision can
                            lead to drastic shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred
                            to as framing effects. Previous work has developed Context Dependent
                            Utility (CDU), a framework integrating Appraisal Theory with decision-theoretic
                            principles. This work extends existing research by presenting a study
                            exploring the behavioral predictions offered by CDU regarding the
                            multidimensional effect of context on decision behavior.


                            The present study finds support for the predictions of CDU regarding
                            the impact of context on decisions: 1) as perceptions of pleasantness
                            increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 2) as perceptions
                            of goal-congruence increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion;
                            3) as perceptions of controllability increase, i.e., perceptions
                            that outcomes would have been primarily caused by the decision maker,
                            behavior tends towards risk-seeking.

                            Creating accurate computational models of human decision making is a vital step towards the realization of socially intelligent systems capable of both predicting and simulating human behavior. In modeling human decision making, a key factor is the psychological phenomenon known as "framing", in which the preferences of a decision maker change in response to contextual changes in decision problems. Existing approaches treat framing as a one-dimensional contextual influence based on the perception of outcomes as either gains or losses. However, empirical studies have shown that framing effects are much more multifaceted than one-dimensional views of framing suggest. To address this limitation, we propose an integrative approach to modeling framing which combines the psychological principles of cognitive appraisal theories and decision-theoretic notions of utility and probability. We show that this approach allows for both the identification and computation of the salient contextual factors in a decision as well as modeling how they ultimately affect the decision process. Furthermore, we show that our multi-dimensional, appraisal-based approach can account for framing effects identified in the empirical literature which cannot be addressed by one-dimensional theories, thereby promising more accurate models of human behavior.

                            state. By leveraging the structures and axioms of expected utility
                            (EU) we are able to operationalize both the determination and the

                            agents typically model their uncertainty in these beliefs as a probability
                            distribution over their possible mental models of others. They then
                            update their beliefs by computing a posterior probability over mental
                            models conditioned on their observations. We present a novel algorithm
                            for performing this belief update over mental models that are in
                            the form of Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems (POMDPs).
                            POMDPs form a common model for decision-theoretic agents, but there
                            is no existing method for translating a POMDP, which generates deterministic
                            behavior, into a probability distribution over actions that is appropriate
                            for abductive reasoning. In this work, we explore alternate methods
                            to generate a more suitable probability distribution. We use a sample
                            multiagent scenario to demonstrate the different behaviors of the
                            approaches and to draw some conclusions about the conditions under
                            which each is successful.

                    Effects-based planning with strategy templates and semantic support.

                    <blockquote><font size="-1">
                            To implement effects-based operations, Joint Air Operations planners
                            must think in terms of achieving desired effects in the strategic
                            campaign through operational course of action levels of planning.
                            The strategy development tools discussed in this paper were designed
                            specifically to encourage effects-based thinking. The tools are used
                            to build plans, plan fragments and, most importantly, "strategy templates".
                            Strategy templates are knowledge-level skeletal planning models that
                            guide the design of strategies that specify the necessary mechanisms
                            and actions to achieve desired effects in the battlespace. The strategic
                            planning knowledge captured in the templates may be employed through
                            wizards to help human planners rapidly apply these general strategic
                            models to specific planning problems. To support the abstract concepts
                            required in the templates, and to guide plan authors in applying
                            these abstract templates to real battlespace planning problems and
                            data, we employ a semantic engine to support the tool capabilities.
                            This engine exploits ontologies represented in the DARPA Agent Markup
                            Language (DAML) and employs the Java Expert System Shell (Jess) as
                            the inference engine to implement the axioms and theorems that encapsulate
                            the DAML semantics. This paper will discuss this technology in supporting
                            Effects-based Operations and its application into Command and Control
                            for Joint Air Operations for kinetic and non-kinetic military operations.
