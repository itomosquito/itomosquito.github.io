  abstract = {One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human decision
	behavior is accounting for the effect of context. Research shows
	that seemingly minor changes in the presentation of a decision can
	lead to drastic shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred
	to as framing effects. Previous work has developed Context Dependent
	Utility (CDU), a framework integrating Appraisal Theory with decision-theoretic
	principles. This work extends existing research by presenting a study
	exploring the behavioral predictions offered by CDU regarding the
	multidimensional effect of context on decision behavior.
	
	
	The present study finds support for the predictions of CDU regarding
	the impact of context on decisions: 1) as perceptions of pleasantness
	increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 2) as perceptions
	of goal-congruence increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion;
	3) as perceptions of controllability increase, i.e., perceptions
	that outcomes would have been primarily caused by the decision maker,
	behavior tends towards risk-seeking.},

      Creating accurate computational models of human decision making is a vital step towards the realization of socially intelligent systems capable of both predicting and simulating human behavior. In modeling human decision making, a key factor is the psychological phenomenon known as "framing", in which the preferences of a decision maker change in response to contextual changes in decision problems. Existing approaches treat framing as a one-dimensional contextual influence based on the perception of outcomes as either gains or losses. However, empirical studies have shown that framing effects are much more multifaceted than one-dimensional views of framing suggest. To address this limitation, we propose an integrative approach to modeling framing which combines the psychological principles of cognitive appraisal theories and decision-theoretic notions of utility and probability. We show that this approach allows for both the identification and computation of the salient contextual factors in a decision as well as modeling how they ultimately affect the decision process. Furthermore, we show that our multi-dimensional, appraisal-based approach can account for framing effects identified in the empirical literature which cannot be addressed by one-dimensional theories, thereby promising more accurate models of human behavior.},

	We present a framework for modeling the psychological phenomenon
	of self-deception in a decision-theoretic framework. Specifically,
	we model the self-deceptive behavior of wishful thinking as a psychological
	bias towards the belief in a particularly desirable situation or
	state. By leveraging the structures and axioms of expected utility
	(EU) we are able to operationalize both the determination and the
	application of the desired belief state with respect to the decision-making
	process of expected utility maximization. While we categorize our
	framework as a descriptive model of human decision making, we show
	that when specific errors are present, the realized expected utility
	of an action biased by wishful thinking can exceed that of an action
	motivated purely by the maximization of expected utility. Finally,
	in order to provide a descriptive characterization of our framework,
	we present a discussion of wishful thinking with respect to the Certainty
	Effect and the Allais Paradox, two specific documented inconsistencies
	of human behavior. In this discussion we show that our framework
	has the descriptive flexibility needed to account for both the Certainty
	Effect and Allais Paradoxes.},

  abstract = {Agents face the problem of maintaining and updating their beliefs
	over the possible mental models (whether goals, plans, activities,
	intentions, etc.) of other agents in many multiagent domains. Decision-theoretic
	agents typically model their uncertainty in these beliefs as a probability
	distribution over their possible mental models of others. They then
	update their beliefs by computing a posterior probability over mental
	models conditioned on their observations. We present a novel algorithm
	for performing this belief update over mental models that are in
	the form of Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems (POMDPs).
	POMDPs form a common model for decision-theoretic agents, but there
	is no existing method for translating a POMDP, which generates deterministic
	behavior, into a probability distribution over actions that is appropriate
	for abductive reasoning. In this work, we explore alternate methods
	to generate a more suitable probability distribution. We use a sample
	multiagent scenario to demonstrate the different behaviors of the
	approaches and to draw some conclusions about the conditions under
	which each is successful.},

	must think in terms of achieving desired effects in the strategic
	campaign through operational course of action levels of planning.
	The strategy development tools discussed in this paper were designed
	specifically to encourage effects-based thinking. The tools are used
	to build plans, plan fragments and, most importantly, "strategy templates".
	Strategy templates are knowledge-level skeletal planning models that
	guide the design of strategies that specify the necessary mechanisms
	and actions to achieve desired effects in the battlespace. The strategic
	planning knowledge captured in the templates may be employed through
	wizards to help human planners rapidly apply these general strategic
	models to specific planning problems. To support the abstract concepts
	required in the templates, and to guide plan authors in applying
	these abstract templates to real battlespace planning problems and
	data, we employ a semantic engine to support the tool capabilities.
	This engine exploits ontologies represented in the DARPA Agent Markup
	Language (DAML) and employs the Java Expert System Shell (Jess) as
	the inference engine to implement the axioms and theorems that encapsulate
	the DAML semantics. This paper will discuss this technology in supporting
	Effects-based Operations and its application into Command and Control
	for Joint Air Operations for kinetic and non-kinetic military operations.}
