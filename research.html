            <h1>Creating Accurate, Contextually Sensitive, Computational Models of Human Decision Making</h1>
            <div style="height:720px">
                <p>
My research interests revolve around creating accurate computational models of the human decision process.
Creating these models is a vital step towards the realization of socially intelligent systems capable of predicting, simulating, and analyzing human behavior. 
This is critical across a diverse range of applications such as those found in social simulation, virtual-human based training, interactive health intervention, embodied conversational agents, and decision support systems. 
</p>

<p>
One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human behavior is accounting for the effect of context on decision behavior. 
Research has shown that seemingly minor changes to the context in which a scenario is presented, or framed, can lead to drastic shifts in behavior, a phenomenon collectively referred to as <strong>framing effects</strong>. 
In a seminal study by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, now referred to as the <i>Asian Disease Study</i>, Tversky and Kahneman showed that human decision behavior could be drastically altered simply by changing the manner in which outcomes are described. 
Given the complexities in both computationally representing context, an inherently ill-defined concept in itself, and subsequently modeling its effect on the decision process most computational approaches to decision making generally do not address framing effects. 
Therefore, my thesis work has primarily focused on creating and empirically validating a computational decision framework which explicitly provides principled guidance for the identification and encoding of context as well as a sound decision-theoretic approach for modeling its effects on pre-existing preferences.
</p>
<p>



My approach for integrating considerations of context into the computational decision process hinges on integrating the psychological theory of appraisal with decision-theoretic approaches to decision making. 
Appraisal Theory addresses the process by which emotions arise from an individual's <i>appraisal</i> of their relationship with the environment along several discrete dimensions such as control, goal conduciveness, and pleasantness.
In particular, Appraisal Theory asserts that various combinations of these appraisals comprise or give rise to different emotions, e.g., happy, sad, angry. 
Furthermore, a great deal of existing research in diverse fields such as economics, psychology, cognitive science, and operation science, has established the significant influence that emotions can have on behavior.
However, no computational models had previously exploited the principles of appraisal theory in order to explicitly address the influence of context in the decision process. 
Therefore, the key insight in my work is to construe appraisals, essentially discrete <i>contextual</i> evaluations of the environment, as ``contextual sensors'' and integrate them directly into the computational decision process.
This allows for the integration of general, flexible, and extensible notions of context into a computational model of decision making in a highly principled, effective manner, and straightforward manner.
</p>

<!--
My current research goals are to continue integrating traditional computational models of decision making with psychological theories of emotion and behavior to create more accurate, flexible, and generalizable models of human decision making. 
In particular, while my graduate work has focused mainly on traditional, risk-based models of decision making, I am looking forward to expanding my work into more complex models such as those used in sequential decision making, preference elicitation, coalition formation, and partially observable environments.
Furthermore, I also plan to explore a variety of immediate practical applications for my work in areas such as medical decision making, computer-based training, and intelligent interface agents.  
For instance, some of my graduate work has involved applying my contextually sensitive decision framework to preference elicitation data in the healthcare domain to more accurately and compactly model patient preferences.
In particular, a study by Kuppermen, et. al., showed that preferences for particular \emph{sequences} of prenatal testing outcomes over the course of a pregnancy could not be reliably estimated, using standard techniques, from preferences over the \emph{individual} outcomes. 
However, by assuming that the context of an outcome is itself influenced by previous outcomes, the contextually sensitive decision framework was able to more accurately predict preferences over sequences of outcomes than standard techniques. 
</p>

<p>
I also look forward to investigating how accurate models of decision making, such as my contextually sensitive decision framework, can be used in prescriptive contexts in which the goal is to influence decision makers. 
This is particularly relevant in domains such as health intervention, marketing, and automated negotiation. 
In this prescriptive context, the driving question becomes whether an accurate model of contextual decision making can be used not only to more accurately predict decisions but also to \emph{influence} them through manipulations in context.
